# React Native Project

This is a React Native project built with React Native CLI. It demonstrates various components and navigation. The project includes tests using Jest to ensure the functionality works as expected.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:coyot1904/financial-assets.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

First, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd financial-assets
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Link native dependencies (if needed)

Although React Native 0.60 and above supports auto-linking for most libraries, in some cases, you might need to link dependencies manually. For the required libraries, auto-linking should work, but in case it doesn't, use:

```bash
npx react-native link
```

Install the necessary CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
```

```bash
npx react-native link
```

```bash
cd ..
```

### 4. Run the project

Now that everything is set up, you can run the project on your preferred platform.

For iOS:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

For Android:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

### 5. Test the app

To run the Jest tests included with the project:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will run the tests using Jest to ensure the functionality is working as expected.
